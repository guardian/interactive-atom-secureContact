		readMoreCopy:If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a	sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted.<h4>How does it work?</h4>With PGP, you will use a “public key” that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient – and no one else – has a corresponding “private key” which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.<h4>Get started</h4>Set up your own public and private keys. Two popular PGP encryption software packages are Gpg4win for Windows and GPG Suite for Macs./n- If you use a browser to access a webmail service, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, you may want to look at Mailvelope./n- Find the public keys of Guardian journalists at pgp.theguardian.com/n- Remember to encrypt your attachments also! The software listed above can do that for you.
